# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide - AI Chatbot

## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

This will install `axios` (required for Hugging Face API calls).

---

### Step 2: Get FREE Hugging Face API Key

1. **Visit**: https://huggingface.co/
2. **Sign up** for a free account (takes 1 minute)
3. **Go to**: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
4. **Click**: "New token"
5. **Name**: "EventPro Chatbot"
6. **Permission**: Select "Read"
7. **Copy** the token (starts with `hf_`)

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Add to your `backend/.env` file:

```env
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_actual_token_here
```

**Example:**
```env
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890
```

---

### Step 4: Start Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
✓ Server running on port 5000
✓ MongoDB connected
✓ Socket.io initialized
```

---

### Step 5: Test the Chatbot

1. Open your frontend application
2. Click the blue floating chat button (bottom-right)
3. Try these test queries:

**Test 1 - AI Response:**
```
"How do I plan a wedding for 200 guests?"
```
Expected: Detailed AI-generated response with 🤖 badge

**Test 2 - Budget Calculation:**
```
"Calculate budget for 150 guests"
```
Expected: Instant breakdown with costs

**Test 3 - Vendor Search:**
```
"Find me photographers"
```
Expected: List of top 3 photographers

## ✅ Verification

### Check if AI is Working:

Look for the 🤖 emoji in chatbot responses. This indicates AI-powered answers.

### Check Backend Logs:

```bash
# Should NOT see these errors:
❌ "Hugging Face API key not found"
❌ "AI Engine error"

# Should see:
✓ "POST /api/ai/chat 200"
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Model is loading" (First Request)

**Normal behavior!** Hugging Face loads the model on first use.

**Solution**: Wait 10-20 seconds, it will auto-retry.

---

### Issue: No AI responses, only rule-based

**Check:**
1. Is `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` in `.env`?
2. Is the key valid? (starts with `hf_`)
3. Did you restart the server after adding the key?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify .env file
cat backend/.env | grep HUGGINGFACE

# Restart server
cd backend
npm run dev
```

---

### Issue: "API rate limit exceeded"

**Free tier limits**: 1000 requests/day

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 24 hours for reset
2. Upgrade to Hugging Face Pro ($9/month)
3. Use multiple API keys (rotate)
