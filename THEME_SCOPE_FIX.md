# Theme Scope Fix - Isolated Luxury Theme to Home Page Only

## Issue Identified
The luxury ArtCulture theme was applied globally, affecting ALL pages in the application including:
- Dashboard pages
- Vendor search
- Event management
- Profile pages
- All other functional pages

This caused confusion as the entire application changed appearance, not just the landing page.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Reverted Global Styles (index.css)
**Restored original color scheme:**
- Primary: `#a78bfa` (Violet) - was `#b64d6d` (Rose pink)
- Secondary: `#ec4899` (Pink) - was `#f5e6d3` (Champagne)
- Accent: `#fbbf24` (Gold) - was `#e5c3a3` (Soft gold)
- All gradient variables restored
- Original shadow values restored
- Original typography (no Playfair Display globally)

### 2. Reverted Component Styles
**Files restored to original:**
- `frontend/src/components/Navbar.module.css` - Original violet/pink theme
- `frontend/src/pages/Auth.module.css` - Original cyan/blue theme

### 3. Isolated Luxury Theme
**Only Home page has luxury theme:**
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` - New luxury landing page
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.module.css` - Contains ALL luxury styling scoped to Home page only

## What's Different Now

### Home Page (Landing) - Luxury Theme âœ¨
- Rose wine pink (#b64d6d) primary color
- Soft gold (#e5c3a3) accents
- Playfair Display serif headings
- Champagne backgrounds
- Elegant, luxury aesthetic
- Custom footer with contact info

### All Other Pages - Original Theme ðŸŽ¨
- Violet (#a78bfa) primary color
- Pink (#ec4899) secondary
- Gold (#fbbf24) accents
- Inter sans-serif throughout
- Modern 3D design
- Original functionality preserved

## Files Modified

### Reverted to Original:
1. `frontend/src/index.css` - Global styles back to violet/pink theme
2. `frontend/src/components/Navbar.module.css` - Original navbar styling
3. `frontend/src/pages/Auth.module.css` - Original auth page styling

### Kept with Luxury Theme:
1. `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` - New luxury landing page
2. `frontend/src/pages/Home.module.css` - Luxury theme scoped to Home only

## Functionality Preserved

âœ… All dashboards work with original styling
âœ… Vendor search maintains original appearance
âœ… Event management unchanged
âœ… Profile pages unchanged
âœ… Authentication pages original
âœ… All navigation and routing intact
âœ… All features and functionality preserved

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Dashboard pages show original violet theme
- [x] Navbar shows original styling on all pages except Home
