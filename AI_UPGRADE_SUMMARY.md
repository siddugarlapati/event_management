## 🎯 How It Works

### Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds):

```
User Message
    ↓
Try AI First (Hugging Face Mistral-7B)
    ↓
✅ Success? → Return AI Response (2-5s)
    ↓
❌ Failed? → Use Rule-Based Fallback (<100ms)
    ↓
Always Get Response (100% Uptime)
```

### Smart Routing:

- **Complex queries** → AI (e.g., "How to plan a wedding?")
- **Budget calculations** → Instant math (e.g., "Calculate for 100 guests")
- **Vendor search** → Database query (e.g., "Find photographers")
- **FAQs** → Quick answers (e.g., "How to book?")

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Model is loading" (503 error)
**Normal!** First request loads the model.
**Solution**: Wait 10-20s, auto-retry implemented.

#### 2. No AI responses
**Check**: Is `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` in `.env`?
**Solution**: Add key and restart server.

#### 3. Slow responses
**Cause**: Model loading or high traffic.
**Solution**: First request is slow, subsequent are fast.

#### 4. Rate limit exceeded
**Cause**: 1000 requests/day limit reached.
**Solution**: Upgrade to Pro or wait 24h.
