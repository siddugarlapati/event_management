## 💡 Smart Features

### Reasoning Engine

For each vendor, AI explains selection based on:

1. **Rating Excellence**
   - ⭐ 4.5+: "Excellent rating"
   - ⭐ 4.0-4.5: "High rating"

2. **Value Proposition**
   - Savings > 20%: "Great value"
   - Shows exact savings amount

3. **Service Breadth**
   - 5+ services: "Comprehensive offerings"
   - Lists service count

4. **Budget Fit**
   - < 80% of budget: "Well within budget"
   - Comfortable margin

5. **Location**
   - Shows vendor location
   - Proximity consideration

### Example Reasoning:
```
🤖 Why AI Selected This Vendor:
⭐ Excellent rating (4.8/5) • 💰 Great value - saves ₹25,000 • 
✨ Comprehensive services (8 offerings) • 💵 Well within budget • 
📍 Available in Mumbai
```
