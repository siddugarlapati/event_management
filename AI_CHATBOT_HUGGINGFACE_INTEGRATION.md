## 📊 How It Works:

### Request Flow:

```
User Message
    ↓

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Issue: "Model is loading" (503 error)
**Solution**: Wait 10-20 seconds, automatic retry is implemented

### Issue: No AI responses
**Solution**: 
1. Check `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` in `.env`
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Fallback responses should still work

### Issue: Slow responses
**Solution**:
1. First request may be slow (model loading)
2. Subsequent requests are faster
3. Consider switching to faster model (Flan-T5)

### Issue: API rate limit
**Solution**:
1. Free tier: 1000 requests/day
2. Upgrade to Pro tier if needed
3. Implement caching for common queries
